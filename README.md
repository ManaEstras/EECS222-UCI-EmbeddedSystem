This project conducts a case study System-level modeling and design to model a special application on System-on-Chip. The overall project goal is to design a suitable embedded system model of this application and describe it in a System-Level Description Language (SLDL). This embedded specification model will then not only be simulated for functional and timing validation, but also be refined for synthesis and implementation as an embedded System-on-Chip (SoC) suitable for use in a digital camera. This article explains the details throughout this case study of Canny Edge Detection, including the basic of Canny application, creating a stimulatable model in SLDL, creating structural hierarchy, pipelining, parallelization, performance estimation and optimization. As the outcomes of each steps of modeling recorded, the general procedure of System-level modeling and design and developing new methodologies of System-on-Chip is also presented. A well-defined methodology like the one presented in this article will help product planning divisions to quickly develop new products or to derive completely new business models
