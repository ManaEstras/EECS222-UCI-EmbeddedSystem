examples/simple/README:
-----------------------

This directory contains some simple SpecC examples
that were developed along with the implementation
of the SpecC compiler mainly for testing purposes.

However, these examples might give a new user of
the SpecC system an idea about what SpecC source
code looks like. Also, these examples can be used
as first test cases to experiment and play around
with SpecC.

For more information about the examples, please
refer to the comments in the SpecC source code
of each example.

Enjoy!
